# SCHOOL SOFTWARE DEVELOPPER IN THE WORLD
##

This is presentation portfolio it has been done by myself
I was inspired to pursue a career in software development by my love of problem-solving and my desire to create things. I have always been fascinated by how computers work and how they can be used to solve complex problems. I am also excited by the potential to use software to make a positive impact on the world.I am also inspired by the many software developers who have made significant contributions to society. For example, the developers of the web browser have made it possible for people all over the world to access information and connect with each other. 
##
Technology & Architecture involve the development of a technical blueprint with regard to the arrangement, interaction, and interdependence of all elements so that system-relevant requirements are met. The software architecture of a system represents the design decisions related to overall system structure and behavior.
##
for example 1. Write the algorithm to find the sum and product of two given numbers. Algorithm: To find the sum and product of two given numbers:
 Step 1: Read A , B
 Step 2: Let Sum= A+B
 Step 3: Let Product=A*B 
Step 4: Print Sum, Product 
Step 5: Stop.

Lack of resources, time constraints and increasing complexity of software are some of the most common challenges in software engineering, threatening the overall equilibrium of the work environment
